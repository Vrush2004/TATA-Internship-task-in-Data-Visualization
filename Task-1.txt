Task 1: Framing the Business Scenario

To prepare for your meeting, you need to draft questions that you think will be important and relevant to the CEO and CMO. This preparation will be your guide as you develop your presentation.For this task, you are only required to draft the questions. Make sure to think both quantitatively and qualitatively. Youâ€™ve been provided a dataset in the resources below to use as the basis for your exploration. Review this data, taking note of what information has been provided, what insights you can garner, and what is relevant to both the CEO and CMO respectively.Create a set of four questions that you anticipate each business leader will ask and want to know the answers to. Make sure you differentiate your questions, as both the CEO and CMO view business decisions through different lenses.

Concerns the CEO may have

1. Which region is producing the most profit, and which region is producing the least?

2. What is the trend for revenue on a monthly basis, and which months have seen the highest rise or fall in revenue?

3. What quarters had the most revenue? Are sales impacted by the seasons?

4. What percentage of overall income are the top customers responsible for? Are these customers essential to the company's success, or is the customers more diverse?

Concerns the CMO may have

5. How many customers make the same purchases again and over again? Do they place similar orders or do they place distinct orders?

6. How long does it take for returning customers to place their next purchase after receiving the first one?

7. Which consumers have placed many orders and how much profit is generated by them?

8. Who are the consumers who have returned the most frequently? What percentage of the revenue do they contribute?
